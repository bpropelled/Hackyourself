These are my notes from Troy Hunt's hack yourself course.  The purpose of the course is to learn about web security by attacking your own site, like a hacker would go at it.  pretty cool.  This way you can better understand an attackers methods and built safeguards against them.

##Fiddler
To start with this course we a re using a tool called Fiddler.  Fiddler is like a HTTP proxy, it sits between the wire between the browser and the target website.  Fiddler can really show what a hacker can see AND DO with the requests and responses of the website.  A hacker can see everything we can see using the same tool, Fiddler.

Using the Composer tab, we can drag in requests and manupilate them to arrange attacks on our website

## Modifying requests and responses
For this we will use the module Fiddler Script.
